# NumPy Basics for Machine Learning

Welcome to the **NumPy Basics for Machine Learning** repository! This repository is designed to help you get started with NumPy, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, essential for machine learning projects.

## 📌 **About NumPy**
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. It is widely used in machine learning for data manipulation and preprocessing.

## 🧑‍💻 **Repository Features**
- Comprehensive overview of NumPy basics
- Visual explanations with NumPy arrays
- Access to official NumPy documentation
